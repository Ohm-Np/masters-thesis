In this study, we are going to check how the processing time will differ - (1) sequential approach (2) parallel approach. Since, we already have the results of sequential approach, here we will process rasters in parallel mode only.

#### Polygons - area of interest (aoi)

1. wdpa polygons (7495)
2. simplified wdpa polygons (4722)
3. sample fishnet gridded cells (216425)


```{r wdpa, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(terra)
library(pbmcapply)


```
